      Can't decide what to do, where to eat, or what to watch?
      decidOR provides a guided experience that enables users to easily make a variety of common decisions when faced with an overwhelming amount of choices. Our application simplifies this process by presenting two options at a time, in order for the user to reach an ultimate decision.

    <p class="whatis-text">
      Start by choosing from one of our Decks: curated collections of common options to choose from.
      Our "bracket-style" algorithm will guide you through the process by presenting you with two options at a time. Keep picking the one you prefer until you arrive at your final decision. A progress bar indicates how far your are through the process, while the color of the bar changes each time you enter a new round of preferences.
