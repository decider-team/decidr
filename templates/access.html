            <p class="whatis-text">We want everyone who visits the decidOR website to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding.</p>

            <h2 class="what-is">What are we doing?</h2>

            <p class="whatis-text">To help us make the decidOR website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>

            <p class="whatis-text">The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). Weâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the target for the decidOR website.</p>

            <h2 class="what-is">How are we doing?</h2>

            <p class="whatis-text">We've worked hard on the decidOR website and believe we've achieved our goal of Level AA accessibility. We monitor the website regularly to maintain this, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch.</p>


            <h2 class="what-is">Let us know what you think</h2>
